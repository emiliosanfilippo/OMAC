# OMAC ontology
The repository contains an OWL ontology, called OMAC - Ontology for Analytic Claims in Music, for musical critical assessments.
The ontology is being developed in the context of a research project in musicology: https://crimproject.org/

Current research work aims at improving and testing OMAC against domain experts' knowledge and case studies. Note also that data included in the owl files of the ontologies are meant for testing purposes only.
