# OMAC ontology
The repository contains an OWL ontology, called OMAC - Ontology for Analytic Claims in Music, for musical critical assessments.
The ontology is being developed in the context of a research project in musicology: https://crimproject.org/

Current research work aims at improving, integrating, and testing OMAC against domain experts' knowledge and case studies.
